# MaliciousLLMs_Demo


To run it, use `python demo_standard.py` or `python demo_malicious.py`. Each demo will generate two links (one for local, the other one for public use).

Please `pip install` any required package manually. Required libraries will be summarised and added to this repo as `requirements.txt` shortly.
